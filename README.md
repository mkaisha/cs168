# Getting Started

These introduction will give you a idea how to run it your local machine to generate the prediction model that we have.

## Prerequisites

Matlab\
Python3\
Stroke Patient CTP DICOM image files

## Python Dependencies
Numpy\
Matplotlib\
Tensorflow/Keras\
Scipy\
Pandas\
Sklearn\
skimage\
scipy.io 

# Process

1. Using preProcessCTP2.m to sort the given .doc files
2. Resize step 1's 4D Array output with scikit_resize.py
3. Resize & interpolate step 2's with resampleCTP.m
4. input the 4D array from the step 3 into cnn.py to generate the model

## Files

### preProcessCTP2.m and preProcessCTP_test2.m

Provided by Professor Fabien Scalzo, which is used to read CTP DICOM image files of an
acquisition and re-order them with respect to slice location and time, and rescale
the image intensity.

Run with Matlab by following command: 
```
[img, meta] = preProcessCTP(imagePath, options)
```
**Input**:\
imagePath: path to input images CTP, DICOM format\
options: ".dcm"

**Output**:\
img: 4D Array of the image (row,column,height,time) \
meta: struct value in Matlab with <time> Acquisition time of each slice and <location> Position of each slice along the Z-axis

### scikit_resize.py

Resize 4D Array of the image that were generated by the **preProcessCTP2.m** with scikit image spatially in format of 128x128x20; x,y,z (slices) \
please put this file under the same dirctory with preProcessCTP2.m file's outputs: .mat format img files 

**Input**:\
.mat format img 4D Array of the image files that  were generated by the **preProcessCTP2.m**

**Output**:\
.mat format img in format of 128x128x20

### resampleCTP.m and resampleCTP_test.m
Provided by Professor Fabien Scalzo, which is used to resize & interpolate files by modifying their time dimension into 60 time points. 

Run with Matlab by following command: 
```
resampledImg = resampleCTP(img, meta, options)
```
**Input**:\
img: Input image CTP; 4D. \
meta: DICOM Tags for CTP image (time is required, which were generated by preProcessCTP2) \
options: ".mat"

**Output**:\
resampledImg:  4D array (3D + time) in size of 128x128x20x60

### cnn.py

Ensure all prerequisites are installed and all filepaths in this program point correctly to the data and label locations.

This program loads all preprocessed data with their labels, generates training and test sets, trains our base cnn, and reports the results of that training.

some code from this file are adapted from TA Abdullah-Al-Zubear Imran's discussion in CS 168 at UCLA

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to Professor Fabien Scalzo at University of California, Los Angeles for providing training data, part of our preprocessing code, and suggestions for constructing and improving our model as well as the project idea, and also thanks to the TA Abdullah-Al-Zubear Imran for his part of CNN code and inspiration.
